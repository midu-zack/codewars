// This function should test if the factor is a factor of base.

// Return true if it is a factor or false if it is not.

// About factors
// Factors are numbers you can multiply together to get another number.

// 2 and 3 are factors of 6 because: 2 * 3 = 6

// You can find a factor by dividing numbers. If the remainder is 0 then the number is a factor.
// You can use the mod operator (%) in most languages to check for a remainder
// For example 2 is not a factor of 7 because: 7 % 2 = 1



function checkForFactor (base, factor) {
  
    return base % factor === 0 ;
     
    
  }




//   Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

// Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

// Example:
// n= 5, m=5: 25
// n=-5, m=5:  0

function paperwork(n, m) {
    return n > 0 && m > 0 ? n * m : 0
